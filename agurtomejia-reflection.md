GPS 1.1 Reflexion
=================

### What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
I am not really struggling with any of the Git concepts learned so far.
### What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
The GPS helped me to see "on live" how a "real" Git-Github workflow works when you are working in a team:
* how to add another member as a contributor
* a member making a pull request and another one checking and merging the branch
* how to compare versions before merging a pull request
* how to resolve a merge conflict

### What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
* Is there any difference between `git add .` and `git add --all`?
* Is there any difference between
`git fetch origin` + `git merge origin` and `git pull`?
* How to add someone as a contributor?

### What still confuses you about Git?
I am not feeling confused about Git so far. 
In the GPS 1.1 Release 2, however, there were some GitHub features mentioned that "make it stand out in the version control management business". I need to "explore" them more deeply because I have never used them so far.

### How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
It was nice! Not a "classic" GPS session because I was pairing with my guide but I felt comfortable during the session. And I feel fulfilled because I ave learn new things!
